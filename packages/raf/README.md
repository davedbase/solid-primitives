Reactive primitives providing support to `window.requestAnimationFrame`.

- [`createRAF`](#createRAF) - Creates an auto-disposing requestAnimationFrame loop.
- [`targetFPS`](#targetFPS) - Used to limit the FPS of [`createRAF`](#createRAF)

## Installation

```
npm install @solid-primitives/raf
# or
yarn add @solid-primitives/raf
```

## `createRAF`

A primitive creating reactive `window.requestAnimationFrame`, that is automatically disposed onCleanup.

It takes a `callback` argument that will run on every frame.

Returns a signal if currently running as well as start and stop methods

```ts
import createRAF from "@solid-primitives/raf";

const [running, start, stop] = createRAF(timeStamp => console.log("Time stamp is", timeStamp));

running(); // => false
start();
running(); // => true
```

#### Definition

```ts
function createRAF(
  callback: FrameRequestCallback
): [running: Accessor<boolean>, start: Fn, stop: Fn];
```

#### Warning

To respect clients refresh rate, timeStamp should be used to calculate how much the animation should progress in a given frame, otherwise the animation will run faster on high refresh rate screens. As an example: A screen refreshing at 300fps will run the animations 5x faster than a screen with 60fps if you use other forms of time keeping that don't consider this. Please see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame

<summary><b>Expand Changelog</b></summary>

0.0.100

Initial release ported from https://github.com/microcipcip/vue-use-kit/blob/master/src/functions/useRafFn/useRafFn.ts.

1.0.6

Released official version with CJS and SSR support.

1.0.7

Updated to Solid 1.3, switched to peerDependencies

1.0.9

Patched double running and added refresh rate warning (patch by [titoBouzout](https://www.github.com/titoBouzout)).

2.0.0

Patch by [titoBouzout](https://www.github.com/titoBouzout):

- allow to limit fps above 60fps
- remove `runImmediately` â€“ animation loop will have to be initialized manually.
- respect `requestAnimationFrame` signature and give `timeStamp` back to the callback instead of a `deltaTime`
- use `cancelAnimationFrame` instead of `!isRunning`

Patch by [thetarnav](https://www.github.com/thetarnav):

- Move FPS limiting feature into a separate `targetFPS` primitive

  3.0.0

Patch by [titoBouzout](https://www.github.com/titoBouzout):

- Remove FPS limiting feature till consensus can be reached about providing other features, like passing down a `delta` or how many frames have been painted in a given second, options that could be used while limiting frames or not.
