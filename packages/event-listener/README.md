# @solid-primitives/event-listener

[![lerna](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20with-lerna-cc00ff.svg)](https://lerna.js.org/)

A helpful event listener primitive that binds window and any element supplied.

`createEventListener` - Very basic and straightforward primitive that handles multiple elements according to a single event binding.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @solid-primitives/event-listener
# or
yarn add @solid-primitives/event-listener
```

## How to use it

```ts
const [add, remove] = createEventListener(document.getElementById("mybutton"), "mouseDown", () =>
  console.log("Click")
);
```

or as a directive

```ts
<MyButton use:createEventListener={() => ["click", () => console.log("Click")]}>Click!</MyButton>;
// you can provide your own event map type as well:
createEventListener<{ myCustomEvent: Event }>(window, "myCustomEvent", () => console.log("yup!"));
```
